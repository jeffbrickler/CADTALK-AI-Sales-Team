## v2.0.0 — 2026-07-08

First team-distributable release. Jeff's Deal Desk is now a proper Claude Code plugin.

### Added
- **RPM plugin install** — `claude plugin add github:jeffbrickler/CADTALK-AI-Sales-Team` installs the full system in one command. No manual file copying.
- **`/cadtalk-setup` onboarding skill** — Guided first-run: identity selection, CLAUDE.md install, MCP connection checks (Pipedrive, ZoomInfo, Outlook, CT Docs, Python/PDF), smoke test, and confirmation. ~10 minutes for a fresh install.
- **CLAUDE.md bundled** — The 900-line Deal Desk identity file is now in the repo and installed automatically by `/cadtalk-setup`. Claude knows it's operating as a CADTALK sales operator the moment setup completes.
- **`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`** — Registers the plugin with RPM. Names it `cadtalk-sales-team`, version `2.0.0`. Points at all 14 skills.
- **Teammate Quick Start in README** — Step-by-step install guide for Chris, Matthew, and Lucca.

### Changed
- **`install.sh` deprecated** — The shell installer is replaced by the RPM plugin. `install.sh` now prints a deprecation notice and exits. Legacy code is preserved below the exit for reference.

### Skills (unchanged from v1)
All 13 CADTALK-customized skills are included:
`/sales`, `/sales-prep`, `/sales-prospect`, `/sales-research`, `/sales-qualify`,
`/sales-contacts`, `/sales-outreach`, `/sales-followup`, `/sales-proposal`,
`/sales-objections`, `/sales-icp`, `/sales-competitors`, `/sales-report`, `/sales-report-pdf`

### Install
```bash
claude plugin add github:jeffbrickler/CADTALK-AI-Sales-Team
/cadtalk-setup
```
